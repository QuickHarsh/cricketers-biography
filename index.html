    <p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Virat Kohli</b> is one of the most celebrated cricketers of modern times, known for his extraordinary batting skills, fierce competitiveness, and charismatic leadership. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Virat displayed a passion for cricket from a very young age. He rose through the ranks with his determination and talent, eventually becoming a global cricketing icon.

        Kohli made his debut for the Indian national team in 2008 and quickly established himself as one of the team's most reliable batsmen. He is known for his aggressive yet consistent batting style, often leading India to victory in high-pressure situations. Over the years, Virat has broken numerous records, including being one of the fastest players to score 8,000, 9,000, and 10,000 runs in One Day Internationals (ODIs).
        
        Apart from his batting prowess, Kohli's leadership has been instrumental in shaping the Indian cricket team. He served as the captain of the team across all formats, leading India to many memorable victories, including a historic Test series win in Australia.
        
        Off the field, Virat is equally admired for his fitness regime, philanthropic activities, and influence as a role model for aspiring cricketers. He is married to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, and together they are among Indiaâ€™s most influential power couples.
        
        Virat Kohli's journey from a budding cricketer in Delhi to becoming one of the greatest batsmen in the world is a testament to his dedication, hard work, and passion for the sport.</p>
