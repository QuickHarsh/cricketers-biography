    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Virat Kohli</b> was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, to Prem Kohli, a criminal lawyer, and Saroj Kohli, a homemaker. He grew up in a middle-class family alongside his elder brother, Vikas, and elder sister, Bhavna. From a young age, Virat showed a keen interest in cricket and was often seen playing with his friends in the narrow lanes of his neighborhood.

        Recognizing his talent and passion for the sport, his father enrolled him at the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) in 1998, when Virat was just nine years old. At the academy, he trained under the guidance of coach Rajkumar Sharma, who played a significant role in shaping Virat’s cricketing skills and discipline. His coaches and peers were impressed by his dedication and focus, even as a child.
        
        Virat's journey in cricket began with representing Delhi in age-group cricket. He quickly rose through the ranks, showcasing his talent in domestic matches. However, his life took a tragic turn in 2006 when his father passed away due to a stroke. At the time, Virat was only 18 years old and playing a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. Despite the personal loss, he chose to continue playing the match the next day, scoring a crucial 90 runs for his team. This incident highlighted his determination and unwavering commitment to cricket.
        
        Virat’s early years were a blend of hard work, resilience, and an unrelenting passion for the game. These qualities set the foundation for his remarkable journey to becoming one of the world’s greatest cricketers.</p>
