    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Virat Kohli’s</b> cricketing journey is a tale of determination, talent, and relentless hard work. He made his international debut in ODIs on August 18, 2008, against Sri Lanka, followed by his T20I debut in 2010 and Test debut in 2011. While his initial performances were modest, he quickly rose to prominence with consistent performances, marking his first ODI century against Sri Lanka in 2009. His breakthrough came during the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy, where he established himself as a reliable middle-order batsman.

        Kohli’s record-breaking streak in ODIs has been phenomenal. He became the fastest batsman to reach 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs, surpassing legends like Sachin Tendulkar. With 46 ODI centuries (as of 2023), he is second only to Tendulkar in this record. In T20Is, Kohli has been equally dominant, earning the Player of the Tournament award in the ICC T20 World Cups of 2014 and 2016. His ability to consistently perform under pressure has made him a force in the shortest format of the game.
        
        In Test cricket, Kohli has displayed remarkable prowess, scoring over 7,500 runs, including 28 centuries. His highest Test score of 254 not out against South Africa in 2019 is a testament to his endurance and skill. As captain, Kohli took India to new heights, leading the team to the top of the ICC Test rankings for over five years. Notable achievements under his captaincy include a historic Test series win in Australia in 2018-19, the first-ever for India, and reaching the final of the ICC World Test Championship in 2021.
        
        Kohli’s contributions to the Indian Premier League (IPL) have been equally significant. Representing Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) since 2008, he scored a record-breaking 973 runs in the 2016 season, including four centuries. His performances in the IPL have made him a crowd favorite and an inspiration for aspiring cricketers.
        
        Recognized globally for his achievements, Kohli has received numerous accolades, including the ICC Cricketer of the Year awards in 2017 and 2018, the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World title for three consecutive years, and India’s prestigious Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 2018. Virat Kohli’s journey, marked by milestones and records, continues to inspire millions, solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest cricketers in history.</p>
