    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Rohit Sharma’s</b> cricketing journey is marked by extraordinary achievements and records. He made his international debut in ODIs on June 23, 2007, against Ireland. Though his early years were inconsistent, he showcased his potential with crucial performances, including a match-winning knock in the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup against South Africa.

        Rohit’s true transformation began when he was promoted to open the innings in ODIs during the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Since then, he has become one of the most prolific openers in cricket history. He holds the record for the highest individual score in ODIs, an astonishing 264 runs against Sri Lanka in 2014. Rohit is also the only batsman in history to score three double centuries in ODIs.
        
        In T20Is, Rohit is a dominant force, holding the record for the most centuries in the format (4). He has also been a key player in ICC tournaments, including the 2019 Cricket World Cup, where he scored a record-breaking five centuries in a single edition.
        
        In Test cricket, Rohit has established himself as a dependable opener, scoring over 3,600 runs (as of 2023), with key performances in both home and overseas conditions. As captain, Rohit has led India to significant victories, including series wins in the 2022 Asia Cup and other bilateral tournaments.
        
        In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Rohit has been a standout player and captain for the Mumbai Indians (MI). Under his leadership, MI has won a record five IPL titles, making him one of the most successful captains in IPL history.</p>
