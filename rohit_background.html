    <p style="font-size: 30px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Rohit Sharma</b>, often referred to as the "Hitman" of Indian cricket, was born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra. He grew up in a modest family with his father, Gurunath Sharma, working as a caretaker in a transport firm, and his mother, Purnima Sharma, being a homemaker. Due to financial constraints, Rohit spent most of his childhood with his grandparents and uncles in Borivali, Mumbai.

        Rohit’s cricketing journey began when his uncle recognized his talent and enrolled him in a local cricket camp. He first gained attention as an off-spinner with batting potential. His coach, Dinesh Lad, noticed his ability with the bat and promoted him to open the innings in a school match, a decision that changed the trajectory of Rohit’s career. He excelled in age-group cricket, representing Mumbai in domestic tournaments and earning a reputation for his elegant stroke play and calm demeanor.
        
        Rohit’s early struggles, including financial hardships, only fueled his determination to succeed. His rise from humble beginnings to becoming one of the most celebrated cricketers in the world is a story of perseverance, hard work, and immense talent.</p>
